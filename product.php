	Are you a mega rich investor with not enough 
	frivilous things to sink your money into?  Well buy yourself a yacht Island.
	They are the pinnacle of everyone knowing you have a ton of gold to your name.
	Buy one of these babies and you're guaranteed to get a harem of girls, and you can fit
	like 50 people on this thing.  Imagine 49 smokin hot naked girls at your beck and call, and hey,
	it's international waters.

<p>
	Since I don't really have much more to say about this here are the lyrics to pink floyd's
	wish you were here. So, so you think you can tell Heaven from Hell, blue skies from pain.
	Can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail?
	A smile from a veil?
	Do you think you can tell?
</p>	
<p>
	Did they get you to trade your heroes for ghosts?
	Hot ashes for trees?
	Hot air for a cool breeze?
	Cold comfort for change?
	Did you exchange a walk on part in the war for a lead role in a cage?
	
	How I wish, how I wish you were here.
	We're just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl, year after year,
	Running over the same old ground.
	What have we found?
	The same old fears.
	Wish you were here.
