		<h2>Our History</h2>
		<p>
			The history of the Super Awesome Website is fairly simple, Eugene Balaguer and Parker Mathewson
			decided one day in college that all they wanted to do was provide the most Super Awesome products
			on this planet. Soon after, they found an architect and an aeronautical engineer from UCSB and a 
			mechanical engineer named Matthew Hart to design the Super Awesome Island Yacht. This Yacht that
			is spoken of is the prized item of the Super Awesome Website, which we build the site around.
