			My love of Penguins has multiplied with the purchase of a Super Awesome Penguin set
		</h3>
		<p>
			Recently I purchased the super awesome penguin set expecting just a set of normal penguins for the 
			Price.  Man was I blown away when those penguins were everything you said they'd be.  One even
			had a genuine rocket launcher!  I might have blown off a foot in the fun, but at least now I get to 
			roleplay that I'm a pirate.  Yaaaarrrr have to try these freakin penguins out.
		</p>
		<p>
			With full disclosure one of the penguins is kinda lame, in my batch his name was jimmy.  Jimmy just
			didn't have bobby's flare.  I mean part of it is that bobby was the rocket launcher shooter, and 
			Jimmy was the one that only got to load it, so I don't really blame him.  Poor Jimmy, always getting
			the slapstick soot face from bobby getting it too close to him.  Tragic really.
		</p>
		<p>
			Towards the end we graduated from small rocket launchers to a big truck launched one. anyways I'm bored of 
			bullshitting so here's some more lyrics- santaria-I don't practice Santeria
			I ain't got no crystal ball
			Well, I had a million dollars but I, I'd spend it all.
			If I could find that Heina, and that Sancho that she's found.
			Well I'd pop a cap in Sancho I'd slap her down.
			
			What I really wanna know, mah baby, mmmm...
			What I really wanna say I can't define.
			Well it's love, that I need. Ohh...
