			My love of Penguins has multiplied with the purchase of a Super Awesome Penguin set
		</h3>

			Recently I purchased the super awesome penguin set expecting just a set of normal penguins for the 
			Price.  Man was I blown away when those penguins were everything you said they'd be.  One even
			had a genuine rocket launcher!  I might have blown off a foot in the fun, but at least now I get to 
			roleplay that I'm a pirate.  Yaaaarrrr have to try these freakin penguins out.

			With full disclosure one of the penguins is kinda lame, in my batch his name was jimmy.  Jimmy just
			didn't have bobby's flare.  I mean part of it is that bobby was the rocket launcher shooter, and 
			Jimmy was the one that only got to load it, so I don't really blame him.  Poor Jimmy, always getting
			the slapstick soot face from bobby getting it too close to him.  Tragic really.
		</p>

			Towards the end we graduated from small rocket launchers to a big truck launched one. anyways I'm bored of 
			bullshitting so here's some more lyrics- santaria-I don't practice Santeria
			I ain't got no crystal ball
			Well, I had a million dollars but I, I'd spend it all.
			If I could find that Heina, and that Sancho that she's found.
			Well I'd pop a cap in Sancho I'd slap her down.
			
			What I really wanna know, mah baby, mmmm...
			What I really wanna say I can't define.
			Well it's love, that I need. Ohh...
